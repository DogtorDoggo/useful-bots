# Reddit notify bot

##### Send yourself a reddit inbox message when there is a new post matching your keywords. It's like IFTTT but more flexible and timely.

##### You will need to get your client_id, client_secret from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ first though, see below

##### Sometimes there are too many inbox messages from your bot. You could use [delete_messages.py](https://github.com/DogtorDoggo/useful-bots/blob/master/reddit/delete_messages.py) to batch delete messages.
